## Features
- Interactive map with click-to-select waypoints.
- Address search and reverse geocoding powered by OpenStreetMap's Nominatim API.
- Route calculation with distance and cost estimation.
- Customizable fuel and AdBlue consumption rates and prices.
- Responsive design with a modern and intuitive user interface.
